    I am a hard-working, enthusiastic software engineer with oodles of polyglot experience in a variety of different settings. I show a keen interest in all aspects of software delivery and spend my spare time inspecting and researching new technologies that can improve my skill base and take me forward.

    Over the past 12 years I have worked in a number of industries such as defence, local government and retail. My broad experience gives me the foundations to deliver robust solutions, apply sound working practices and make good decisions.
